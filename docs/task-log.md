### Key Files Read

- `app.py`
- `README.md`
- `.gitignore`
- `SKILL.md` in the 2026-05-12 workspace, used earlier as UI guidance
- `taste-skill-beta-v2/taste-skill/SKILL.md`, used earlier as Taste Skill guidance

### Key Files Modified

- `app.py`
  - Added review functions and display.
  - Added upload cache helpers.
  - Added batch processing summary.
  - Added fiber allocation table generation.
  - Added formal generation gating when review errors exist.
- `README.md`
  - Added review, batch upload, recent cache, and fiber allocation documentation.
- `.gitignore`
  - Added `.design_file_cache/`.
- `AGENTS.md`
  - Added long-term project rules.
- `docs/handoff.md`
  - Added current handoff.
- `docs/task-log.md`
  - Added current process log.

### Commands Run

Syntax check with fallback Python:

```powershell
& "C:\Users\cheng\.cache\codex-runtimes\codex-primary-runtime\dependencies\python\python.exe" -m py_compile app.py
```

Page health check:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://127.0.0.1:8501 -UseBasicParsing | Select-Object -ExpandProperty StatusCode
```

Targeted file checks:

```powershell
Test-Path AGENTS.md
Test-Path docs\handoff.md
Test-Path docs\task-log.md
```

### Successful Results

- `py_compile app.py` passed after latest fixes.
- `http://127.0.0.1:8501` returned `200`.
- Review function testing earlier showed it could detect:
  - Duplicate site ID
  - Cable distance errors/high risk
  - Fiber count errors
  - Fiber core duplicate occupancy
  - Power supply risk
  - Resource duplicate occupancy
- Built-in demo data generated a fiber allocation table successfully.

### Failed / Important Error Results

Runtime error after adding cache:

```text
NameError: name 'CACHE_INDEX_FILE' is not defined
```

Cause:

- Cache functions referenced `CACHE_INDEX_FILE`, but the top-level import/constants block had not been updated.

Fix:

- Added `hashlib`, `datetime`, `Path`.
- Added `RECENT_FILE_LIMIT`, `CACHE_DIR`, `CACHE_INDEX_FILE`.

Environment issue seen earlier:

```text
Unable to create process using '"C:\Users\cheng\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe" ...'
```

Workaround:

- Used bundled Codex Python for syntax checks.

### Pending Items

- Visually verify the latest UI in browser after the cache/fiber/batch changes.
- Confirm multi-file upload and recent-file cache behavior manually.
- Confirm fiber allocation table display and Excel sheet output from the UI.
- Commit/push changes if requested.
- Continue keeping `docs/handoff.md` and `docs/task-log.md` updated after every future task.

### Batch Review Source Follow-up

- Added file-source attribution to lightweight review detail rows so batch-upload errors show the originating file.
- Added batch review detail aggregation for all uploaded files.
- Replaced the review detail table filters with five tabs:
  - `全部明细`
  - `错误项`
  - `高风险项`
  - `提醒项`
  - `正常项`
- Kept the existing Streamlit single-file processing flow and generation behavior scoped to the current app structure.

### Commands Run For This Follow-up

```powershell
& "C:\Users\cheng\.cache\codex-runtimes\codex-primary-runtime\dependencies\python\python.exe" -m py_compile app.py
```

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://127.0.0.1:8501 -UseBasicParsing | Select-Object -ExpandProperty StatusCode
```

- Browser refresh verified the five review tabs are present and no visible runtime exception appeared.
- Function-level batch review check confirmed `source_file` exists and includes uploaded file names.

### Rule DOCX Output

- Generated separate Word documents for the current rule descriptions:
  - `docs/程序检查规则.docx`
  - `docs/数据校验规则.docx`
- Added `docs/build_rule_docs.py` as the reproducible builder for these documents.
- Ran:

```powershell
& "C:\Users\cheng\.cache\codex-runtimes\codex-primary-runtime\dependencies\python\python.exe" docs\build_rule_docs.py
```

```powershell
& "C:\Users\cheng\.cache\codex-runtimes\codex-primary-runtime\dependencies\python\python.exe" -m py_compile docs\build_rule_docs.py
```

- DOCX render QA was attempted with `render_docx.py`, but failed because LibreOffice/soffice was not available:

```text
FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2] 系统找不到指定的文件。
```
